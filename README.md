# <strong>Introduction: 2022 Qatar World Cup Power Ranking and Winner(Simulation)</strong><br>
Introduction: Predicting the winner of 2022 Qatar World Cup<br>
Method:
- 1. Read Data
- 2. Feature Selection:
    - Goal Difference = AVG(Offense Score) - AVG(Diffense Score)
    - Current Rank
    - Average Rank for 10 years
    - Not Friendly Game

- 3. Model Selection: Logistic Regresion, XGBoost, Gradinet Boosting, Ada Boosting
- 4. Simulation
- 5. Visualization
